## Introduction ##

This is my professional portfolio. In it you'll find the projects I've been working on as well as a contact form and links to my social media. It is built using Materialize and css and liberal doses of coffee.

## Usage ##

Anyone is free to find the source code here on GitHub. You can access the files through cloning the repo, and the link underneath the website screenshot will take you to the live page. It should be responsive on a wide variety of devices and browsers.
