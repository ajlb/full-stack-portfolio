      <p>I am currently an IAM support engineer based in San Diego, CA. I script login flows for customers wishing to use 
          form-based authentication in a Single-Sign On environment.</p>
      <p>I used to do web development about 20 years ago and moved into different roles in data analsis, 
        database administration, server administration, network administration, and customer success.
        I am looking forward to getting back into full stack development because I enjoy making things.
